      <h1>Ty's Programming Portfolio</h1>
      <h1> My Final Project </h1>
      <p> Welcome To Dots & Boxes! I am pretty sure you have heard of this mini-game before but we have created a <br>
      2.0 version with many different styles. A very short description on how to play is two-players will take turns <br>
      picking lines trying complete a box to get a point. The player with the most completed boxes and points, shall be <br>
      the winner! For a more descriptive way to play, click the picture of the game and head to "Help". Good Luck!
      </p>
