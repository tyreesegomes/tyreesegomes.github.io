<p style="color:white;"> Hey ! My name is Tyreese but I prefer to be called Ty. I am a freshmen at the University of Rhode Island and I am pursuing
a career in BA of Computer Science. I like to play basketball, football, and video games. Also, I enjoy sleeping and will take 
a quick nap anywhere. If you see me on campus, do not hesitate to say hello ! <br>
At Central Falls High School I started playing football for them my sophomore year as running back and corner back. 
It was not until senior year I changed my offensive position to wide receiver. Senior year we also won a Division 3 Superbowl.
I always played basketball since I was younger but never really joined a team. Video games will always be my favorite because 
when I am feeling low I can just jump on my playstation 4 and play fortnite or nba 2k20 to cheer me up.
