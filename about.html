<h1 style= "color: white;">About Me</h1>

<p style= "color: white;"> Hey ! My name is Tyreese but I prefer to be called Ty. I am a freshmen at the University of Rhode Island and I am pursuing
a career in BA of Computer Science. I like to play basketball, football, and video games. Also, I enjoy sleeping and will take 
a quick nap anywhere. If you see me on campus, do not hesitate to say hello !
